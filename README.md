Promises
========

Basic code for displaying native promises

tl;dr return a Promise object from every async method 

the structure of a Promise Object constructor is:

new Promise(function(approve,reject));

These methods are shorthand for returning a value immediately instead of waiting
Promise.resolve()
Promise.reject()
